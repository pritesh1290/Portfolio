                                    Personal stories. Another factor in the wild success of the Shopify blog is the personal stories they share from their community. Filled with valuable lessons and tips for other entrepreneurs, this user-generated content has proven to be very popular.
                                    If e-commerce store owners and other online businesses are the target audience for your blog, be sure to check out the Shopify blog for inspiration.
